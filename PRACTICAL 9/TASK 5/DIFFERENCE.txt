Major Differences between Structures and Classes in C++ are:

1.) In Structures, if no access specifier is specified, all members are set to 'public' whereas if no access specifier is defined, all members are set to 'private'.

2.) Structure instance is called the 'structure variable', a class instance is called 'object'.

3.) In 'struct', memory is allocated on the stack and in 'class' memory is allocated on the heap.

4.) Structures may have only parameterized constructor while classes it may have all the types of constructors and destructors.

5.) Structures does not support inheritance but Classes support multiple types of inheritances.
