The problem with this task was to figure out when upon declaring a character data type variable ‘a’, we try to input “123” and while printing the same gives out “1” only.

Part-1 shows this condition only.

Part-2 explains the correct way it is implemented when we have to input multiple charcters in the variable.

(cin) function only takes one or more correctly the first chracter of the string. In order to counter this problem, we use getline function.
