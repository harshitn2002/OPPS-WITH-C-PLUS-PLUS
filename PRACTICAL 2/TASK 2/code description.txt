The code represents output when the header file <iostream> is presented as <iostream.h>

the output gives out error as no such file or directory, this is because "iostream.h" is deprecated and not a
standard header. It was used in older programs before C++ was standardized, Functions like cout were defined inside iostream.h

After C++ got standardized, all these functions like cout got moved into the std namespace. TO adjust to this change, non .h versions of some of these
headers were introduced and declared as standard headers.
